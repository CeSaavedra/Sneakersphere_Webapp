Seller API Node application and Docs written by Kyle Merkins
Primary key sellerID is unique to each account

Emails are unique, email and password matching are used to fetch the sellerID, which can be used for all other API operations

userNames are NOT UNIQUE

All GET requests return an array of JSON objects (with just ONE obj in the array) with key:value pairs that follow one naming scheme:
ex: GetSellers/
[
 {
        "firstName": "tester",
        "lastName": "Ltest",
        "streetAddress": "29 tester St",
        "city": "testCity",
        "state": "Maryland",
        "email": "testEmail@gmail.com",
        "password": "testPass",
        "phoneNumber": "23215850",
        "birthday": "2000-12-19",
        "gender": "male",
        "subscriberCount": "0",
        "zipCode": "21921",
        "postCount": "0",
        "sellerID": "1",
        "userName": "testUsername"
 }
]
You will have to access the first index of the array to access the object


PUT requests follow the same structure, where the body of the request will contain the relevant key:value pair that is to be updated, such as:
{
   "lastName":"newLastName"
}

birthday is a DATE type, not just a string, GET requests will show a string with added time zone info
